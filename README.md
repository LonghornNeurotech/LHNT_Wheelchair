## Project Overview

The wheelchair project at LHNT aims to build a electronic wheelchair controlled by EEG, and EMG, combining efforts from the electronics, design, and hardware-software integration teams. The wheelchair will have 5 degrees of freedom: stopped, moving forward, backward, turning left or right. It will communicate wirelessly with a computer that determines its movements. Ultimately, the wheelchair will provide accessible motion, controlled entirely by the user's neural data.
